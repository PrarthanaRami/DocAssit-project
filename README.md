# Machine Learning Patient Wellness Prediction Project

This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is well or not based on their medical report counts. The model is implemented using Logistic Regression and deployed using Flask.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assist in determining the wellness status of a patient by analyzing various medical report counts.

## Project Structure

- `datas.csv/`: Contains the dataset used for training the model.
- `model.pkl/`: Stores the serialized machine learning model using Pickle.
- `templates/`: Contains the source code for desiging webpage .
- `main.py`: Flask application for serving the model predictions.

## Setup
